# Java OOP projects

This repository contains java projects which was done as a part of the program construction (OOP) module in semester 2

- this repository has three main projects which covers all of the object oriented programming fundamentals, some multi threading fundamentals,IO streams and serialization and exception handling fundamentals in java

## ATM project

This project was done under OOP section which we used our knowledge to create a banking system which obeys OOP principles, following concepts were used in this project
- Classes
- Object
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
  
## Multithreading project

This project was done under the threads and multithreading section. This was a study room reservation system where multiple users can reserve the study room at the same time. Here we learned about the classical producer consumer problem and how to handle deadlocks and race conditions. Main concepts used were,

- Java Thread library
- Producer and consumer
- Function synchronization
- deadlocks
- locks and mutexes

## Io streams and Serialiation

In this lab we used the knowledge of OOP , Serializarion and exeption handling to simulate a point of sales system

- creating custom exception classes
- serilaizing and deserializing objects in java
